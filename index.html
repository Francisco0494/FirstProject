            <p class="text">Hello and welcome to my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
                 This project marks the beginning of my journey into the world of web development,
                 where I aim to create dynamic and visually appealing websites. 
                 In this introductory text, I would like to share a little bit about myself and my interests.
            </p>
            <p class="text">My name is Francisco, and I am passionate about various subjects including statistics,
                history, and economics. These fields not only intrigue me but also provide valuable insights that I
                 often try to integrate into my projects. Living and working in Tilburg,
                  Netherlands, I find myself constantly inspired by the rich cultural heritage and innovative spirit of this city.
            </p>
            <p class="text">Tilburg, with its blend of tradition and modernity, provides a perfect backdrop for
                 my explorations in technology. The city's vibrant community and progressive outlook encourage me
                  to pursue my passion for programming. In my professional life, I engage with diverse tasks that
                   challenge and stimulate my analytical thinking, but it's in my spare time that I dive deep into
                    the world of coding.
            </p>
            <p class="text">My interest in statistics stems from a fascination with data and numbers. 
                I love analyzing trends, patterns, and probabilities, which has honed my attention to detailâ€”an
                 essential skill in programming. Similarly, my passion for history allows me to appreciate the 
                 context and evolution of technologies over time. Understanding historical developments provides
                  me with a unique perspective on current technological advancements.
           </p>
           <p class="text">Balancing my work and study schedule can be challenging, but my passion for programming
             keeps me motivated. Every line of code I write is a testament to my dedication and enthusiasm for learning.
              I find joy in solving problems and creating solutions that can be shared with others.
         </p>
            <p class="text">Economics, with its focus on resource allocation and decision-making, complements my
        analytical skills and enhances my understanding of market dynamics and user needs. This knowledge
         proves invaluable when designing user-centric applications that are not only functional but also economically viable.
        </p> 
        <p class="text">As I delve into the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am constantly amazed by the endless
             possibilities these technologies offer. HTML provides the structure, CSS brings the style, and JavaScript 
             adds interactivity, enabling me to create immersive web experiences. Each project I undertake is a step towards
              mastering these tools and expanding my skillset.
       </p>
       <p class="text">This project is a culmination of my efforts and a reflection of my journey so far.
         It showcases my ability to blend creativity with technical expertise, and I hope it serves as a
          stepping stone to more complex and innovative projects in the future. Thank you for visiting my 
          project, and I hope you find it as enjoyable to explore as it was for me to create.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Your feedback is invaluable to me as I continue to learn and grow in this field.
             Feel free to reach out with any comments or suggestions. Here's to the beginning of an exciting adventure in web development!
